<p>In Ghana most especially the deprived communities in the Northern Region and its catchments areas are people live and work without being able to improve their standard of living. Most of the people living in these areas are peasant farmers and petty traders with minimal or no education at all, therefore cannot secure any significant well paying job.

    In this same Region most people can not secure good drinking water also parents do not see the need to send their children to school. Falling of trees indiscriminately without replacing is a key problem to the nation, youth sensitization in rural Ghana on substance use and volunteerism has not left out, this state of affairs has been partly due to financial problems and also ignorant, as a result “AEDIRG” is taking it as part of its responsibility to support these projects.
